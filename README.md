### Self Deriving Linear Regression from Exponential Family and GLM Assumptions
- Trying to use the more generalized form of the exponential family, to arrive at the 
- stuck/it's taking too much time for me to derive the formula necessary for me to get my hypothesis function 

### Creating my own Generalized Linear Model
- With above figured out, will be able to fib with parameters to create a model more tailored to my dataset

### Feature Engineering
- Extracting more features from reviews of businesses
- First technique: collecting normalized unigram and bigram of good and bad words
- Second technique: conducint structure and senitment analysis on each sentence of review
